# clustord

The package is not frequently built as a full package yet, so it would be better to take a clone of the code, and source the various files, which are found in the "R" folder.

The three top-level functions are rowclustering, columnclustering and biclustering, all in the "clustering.R" file, and they have standard R-style manuals to explain their usage.
