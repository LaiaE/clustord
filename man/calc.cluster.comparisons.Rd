\title{Calculate comparison measures between two sets of clustering results}
\usage{
calc.cluster.comparisons(ppr1, ppr2)
}
\arguments{
\item{ppr1}{Posterior probabilities of cluster membership, calculated as ppr.m
or ppc.m in the output of \code{\link{rowclustering}}, \code{\link{columnclustering}}
or \code{\link{biclustering}}.
The rows of ppr1 give the entries that have been clustered, and each column
corresponds to one cluster.}

\item{ppr2}{Posterior probabilities of cluster membership from a different
clustering run, which will be compared to ppr1.}
}
\value{
A list with components:

    \code{ARI}: Adjusted Rand Index.

    \code{NVI}: Normalised Variation of Information.

    \code{NID}: Normalised Information Distance.
}
\description{
Given two sets of posterior probabilities of membership for clusters,
calculate three measures to compare the clustering memberships.
}
\details{
The three measures are the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), the Normalised
Variation of Information (NVI) and the Normalised Information Distance (NID).

The three measures are documented in

responses with application to ecological communities.
